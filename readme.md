This assignment demonstrates how to work with arrays and objects in JavaScript by creating and managing a list of customers. The program creates a customers array with customer objects, adds a new customer using .push(), removes a customer using .shift(), updates a customer’s email, and adds a purchase to a customer’s purchases array. It also uses .forEach() to loop through the array and display each customer’s name, email, and purchases using template literals. Overall, the assignment shows how customer information can be stored, updated, and displayed using basic JavaScript array methods and object operations.
